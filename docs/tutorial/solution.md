Once we have finalized the main components of the solution, it is time for integration.
We now want to iterate over all the *LOGO* partitions of the dataset, generate a synthetic reference through the model of choice, and finally estimate the misalignment between the left-out gradient and the synthetic reference.
This solution, must also abide by the API we have envisioned.

The above code allows us to use our estimator as follows:

```python
from eddymotion.estimator import EddyMotionEstimator

estimated_affines = EddyMotionEstimator.fit(dmri_dataset, model="b0")
```

## What's next? - Testing!

Once we have our first implementation functional, we should think of some unit-tests for our code.

```{admonition} Exercise
Write a unit test for the `TrivialB0Model`.
This test would just make sure that, regardless of the particular partition of the input dataset, a *b=0* map is always returned.
```

**Solution**: in this solution, we are using `pytest` to integrate the test into a higher-level test suite.

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-cell]

import numpy as np
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("split_index", list(range(30)))
def test_TrivialB0Model(split_index, dmri_dataset):
    model = TrivialB0Model(
        dmri_dataset.gradients,
        S0=dmri_dataset.bzero,
    )
    data_train, data_test = dmri_dataset.logo_split(split_index)
    model.fit(data_train[0])
    predicted = model.predict(data_test[1])

    assert np.all(dmri_dataset.bzero == predicted)
```

## And after testing? - Validation!

Once we have a sufficient portion of our code *covered* by unit-tests, then we would add some *integration* tests that give us confidence that our bullet-proof individual components also work together.
Only after we have both steps secure, we can run benchmarks and evaluations from which we learn whether our solution works, and characterize its limitations.

The main strategy to validate this software would entail finding/acquiring a special dataset where motion is not present or extremely low, in which we *introduce* a known head-motion pattern with which we are going to challenge our estimator.
Some ideas to achieve this are:

- a dataset acquired with special sequences that can do prospective motion correction, or
- a dataset that has been acquired under very controlled settings, with an extremely collaborative participant who was also wearing a personalized mold, or
- a fully synthetic dataset such as the Fiber Box, or
- a fully synthetic dataset containing a repeated *b=0* image (this evaluation would be limited to work with the `TrivialB0Model`, for instance).
