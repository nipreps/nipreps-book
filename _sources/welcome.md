## *Implementing a head-motion correction algorithm for diffusion MRI in Python, using DIPY and NiTransforms*

**Summary**.
This tutorial walks attendees through the development of one fundamental step in the pre-processing of diffusion MRI data using a community-driven approach and relying on existing tools.
The tutorial justifies the *NiPreps* approach to pre-processing, describing how the framework attempts to enhance or extend the MRI scanner to produce "analysis-grade" data.
This is important because data produced by the scanner is typically not digestible for statistical analyses directly.

Researchers resort to either:

1. modifying their experimental design so that it matches the requirements of large-scale studies that have made all of their software tools publicly available
1. creating custom pre-processing pipelines tailored to each particular study

This tutorial has been designed to engage signal processing engineers and imaging researchers in the *NiPreps* community, demonstrating how to fill in the gaps of their pre-processing needs regardless of their field.

```{admonition} Objectives
- Get a tour of the *NiPreps* framework
- Learn how to contribute to "open source" software
- Understand the basics of dMRI data and pre-processing
- Discover how to integrate some of the tools in the *NiPreps* framework
